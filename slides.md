# Software Developer Lifecycle

### A guide to growing your engineering career

---

# The University Path is Clear

- Go to class (or at least read the slides)
- Do the homework
- Beg smart friends for help (pre-ChatGPT days)
- Grind LeetCode, build cool side projects

**Then you graduate...**

---

# Welcome to the Real World

- Suddenly you're in a totally different environment
- CS grads: "Where do I use O(N) complexity?"
- SE grads: "What the hell is CI/CD?"
- Lucky ones learn this in internships
- Others discover it after working hard to land that first role

---

# The Questions Nobody Answers

- What are my career paths as a software engineer?
- Do I have to become a manager to grow?
- What matters most at different levels?

**Most don't know what actually matters**

---

# Why Care About Your Career?

It's not about:
- Climbing the corporate ladder
- Impressing friends with fancy titles

*(Though "Senior Engineer at 25" does get a laugh at parties)*

---

# Skills Trump Passion

> "Skills Trump Passion in the Quest for Work You Love"
> — Cal Newport, *So Good They Can't Ignore You*

Build **career capital**: rare and valuable skills you can later trade for a career that fits you.

---

# Become So Good They Can't Ignore You

- Earn interesting problems to solve
- Be capable of executing when opportunity calls
- Skill mastery leads to autonomy
- Choose the direction of your own work

**Be the driver, not the passenger.**

3. The Well-Rounded Software Engineer
4. The Pragmatic Tech Lead
5. Role-Model Staff and Principal Engineers

# Career Paths: The Dual Ladder

| IC Track | Manager Track |
|----------|---------------|
| Software Engineer | — |
| Senior Engineer | — |
| Staff Engineer | Manager / STO |
| Senior Staff Engineer | Director |
| Principal Engineer | Managing Director |

*Switching between tracks is more common than you'd think*

# Owning Your Career

> The best advice I received: **own your career.**
> Nobody will care about your growth unless you do.

- Some managers care about your aspirations, some... less
- Those who know what they want are easier to help
- Take initiative, be reflective, set goals

---

# Be Someone Who Gets Things Done

- If you don't get things done, almost nothing else matters
- Work hard to finish tasks with quality at a decent pace
- Over-deliver when you can
- Aim to get **impactful** things done
- Understand your team and customer priorities

---

# Ask For Feedback

Asking for feedback (genuinely) is one of the best ways to grow:

- Code reviews to improve your code
- Ideas and proposals to get alignment
- Feature delivery retrospectives
- Design documents and diagrams

**Remember: feedback is a gift**

---

# Make Your Manager Your Ally

Your manager has the biggest impact on your career at the company:

1. Have regular 1:1s — discuss work, goals, challenges
2. Understand their goals — what matters for the team?
3. Establish trust — be honest and transparent
4. Get your work recognized — present in larger meetings

---

# Pace Yourself

Like athletes, use the **stretch, execute, coast** model:

- **Stretching**: Learning intensely. Fun but can cause burnout
- **Executing**: Normal work rhythm. Pull your weight
- **Coasting**: Temporary lower intensity. More than a few days becomes obvious

*Mix these to optimize for long-term growth*

---

# The Competent Software Developer

---

# Getting Things Done

Leads always know which engineers are reliable.

This leads to:
- Higher visibility projects
- More challenging tasks
- Accelerated learning
- Increased autonomy

---

# Focus on #1 Priority

- There are always items to work on
- Ask: "If I only got one thing done this week, what would it be?"
- Make a habit of always completing your #1 priority
- Work with your lead to ensure you're assessing priority correctly

---

# Unblock Yourself

Building software has many unforeseen obstacles:

1. **Recognize when you're blocked** — 30min to 1hr of no progress
2. Try rubber ducking, draw it out, read docs, take a walk
3. **Get support** — organize your thoughts, ask clarifying questions
4. Understand the solution so you can resolve it next time
5. Keep a "issues and resolutions" note if this happens often

---

# Break Down Work & Seek Mentors

**Break down work:**
- Understand the "why" — how does this affect the end user?
- Turn that into stories, then tasks, then subtasks

**Seek mentors:**
- You're on a team with smart, kind, helpful people
- Ask for 1:1s, understand how they got good
- Ask for feedback on what you're working on

---

# Take Initiative

The most productive engineers take on opportunities:

- Quickly become the expert on something new
- Document unclear things
- Investigate new tools or frameworks
- Talk with your manager about upcoming projects

*At dynamic teams, there are many opportunities for this*

---

# Coding: The Core Skill

Writing code is still the core of software engineering.

You want to translate ideas into working code — the essential skill.

---

# Practice Coding... A Lot!

1. **Code Regularly** — Daily practice brings you from alright to comfortable. No real substitute.

2. **Code Review** — Get feedback on all code, even from Copilot. Ask teammates directly.

3. **Read Code** — Check out others' code, try to run/improve it. Read open source projects like React or Bun.

---

# Software Development Skills

1. **Become proficient in a language** — Go deep early in your career. Understand memory, compilation, performance.

2. **Be great at debugging** — Quick debugging = faster iteration. Make smaller changes, test often. Observe how great devs debug.

---

# Refactoring & Testing

**Refactoring:**
- Adjust code as new information arrives
- Red, green, refactor loop
- Note what confuses others in reviews

**Testing:**
- Reliable engineers test before code review
- Care about edge cases and failure scenarios

---

# Tools of the Productive Developer

**Physical tools:**
- Type 70+ WPM
- Navigate your editor efficiently
- Don't let speed be your bottleneck

**Local dev tools:**
- Quick compile/run cycles to stay "in the zone"
- Master the terminal and git
- Experiment with AI tools

---

# Iterate Quickly

- Understand your project's existing code structure
- Have someone walk you through, or draw out the modules
- Know how to debug CI/CD
- Understand your deployment environment
- Know which logs and dashboards to check

---

# Summary: The Competent Developer

Competent Software Developers **get things done reliably**.

The single best advice: **practice, practice, practice**.

Spend lots of time coding and learning how to improve your quality and processes from other developers.

*This foundation pays dividends for your entire career.*
