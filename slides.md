# Software Developer Lifecycle

### A guide to growing your engineering career

---

# The University Path is Clear

- Go to class (or at least read the slides)
- Do the homework
- Beg smart friends for help
- Grind some LeetCode
- Build cool side projects

**Then you graduate...**

---

# Welcome to the Real World

- Suddenly you're in a totally different environment
- CS grads wonder: "Where do I use O(N) complexity?"
- SE grads stress: "What the hell is CI/CD?"

**But worse...**

Most don't know what actually matters as a software engineer

---

# The Questions Nobody Answers

- What are my career paths as a software engineer?
- Do I have to become a manager to grow?
- What matters most at different levels?

---

# Why Care About Your Career?

It's not about:
- Climbing the corporate ladder
- Impressing friends with fancy titles

*(Though "Senior Engineer at 25" does get a laugh at parties)*

# Skills Trump Passion

> "Skills Trump Passion in the Quest for Work You Love"
> — Cal Newport, *So Good They Can't Ignore You*

Build **career capital**: rare and valuable skills you can later trade for a career that fits you.

---

# Become So Good They Can't Ignore You

- Earn interesting problems to solve
- Be capable of executing when opportunity calls
- Skill mastery leads to:
  - Career satisfaction
  - Autonomy
  - Choosing your own direction

**Be the driver, not the passenger.**
