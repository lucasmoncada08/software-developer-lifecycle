# Software Develop*er* Lifecycle (SDLC)

- Throughout University the path is pretty clear. Go to class, or at least read the slides, do the homework and occasionally go to a tutorial session or your smart friends to beg for help (pre-chatgpt days). Also, do some leetcode questions and try to build some cool things the side. 
- When you enter your career as a software developer you suddenly realize you are in a totally different world. For some that are lucky this is in some internships/co-ops, for many others these days, it is after they have worked their butt off to find role that will take a chance on new dev. 
- For most roles, computer science folk enter the job market wondering where how they will write their first API in O(N) time complexity. Software engineering graduates stress about how to properly use git and what the hell CI/CD is? 
- But worse, most do not even know what actually matters when you become a software engineer. What are my career paths as a software engineers? Do I have to become a manager to grow in my career? What matters most at the different levels of software engineering? 

# Why Care About Your Career

- Before diving into learning how you might understand and excel as a software engineer, I realized I should take moment to explain why I think it matters. For me, it is not about being devoted to the corporate ladder or trying to get a great title to impress my friends; although it does get a laugh to say at a party that "I am a very wise and experienced 25 year old *Senior* Engineer". 
- Much of it to me comes from Cal Newport and his writing, specifically his book "So Good They Can't Ignore You". Here he introduces the idea that "Skills Trump Passion in the Quest for Work You Love". 
- Furthermore, he goes on that you shoud build what he calls “career capital”: the rare and valuable skills you accumulate so you can later spend them on a career that fits you. In team form, that idea becomes: become so good at something that you earn interesting problems to solve. Not even just as in someone gifts you these special tasks, but that when you seek to solve an interesting problem that calls for you, you are capable of executing that.
- Cal also adds that skill mastery isn’t just for career satisfaction; it’s how we invent the future, earn autonomy, and ultimately choose the direction of our own work, rather than being passengers to it. 
- Here on this team we have the rare opportunity of creating new and useful things with high automony and ceiling for learning with a safety net of a great culture and leadership chain. Take advantage of it.

# Map of a Successful Software Developer Career
- As many of you know, these ideas are not concepts I was stumbled on originally, most of them are from some of the several amazing books I was lucky enough to find. They present these ideas much better than I can and I recommend you read them, but it just takes a bit longer.
We will follow a similar structure to the Software Engineering Guidebook by Gergely Orsov with my own filter and other ideas from The  Talking with Tech Leads by Patrick Kua, Staff Engineer by Will Larson, and The Staff Engineer's Path by Tanya Reilly.

# Developer Career Foundations
## Career Paths
At companies where engineering grows beyond ~50 people, the dual path career ladder is typically found.
   IC Ladder              | Manager Ladder
1. Software Engineer      | 
2. Senior Engineer        |
3. Staff Engineer         | Manager / STO 
4. Senior Staff Engineer  | Director
5. Principal Engineer     | Managing Director
...

This allows people to progress in their career without being forced into management. Switching between the IC and Management tracks is more common than you would think. This allows for a very powerful perspective growing teams and growing org's technology. Often the best managers are the ones that you have to rip the keyboards out of their hands, but it is a very different skillset and is humbling.

## Owning your Career
The best advice I received as a software engineer was to own my career. Nobody will care about your growth unless you do. 

I have had several managers already in my career, some care about your aspirations and some care... less. As a tech lead I really care about the growth of my teammates and noticed a few things:
- Sometimes I could tell that no one really asked about their goals in an honest conversation beyond the interview.
- Some people are easier to help than others. I had better conversations with those who knew what they wanted relative to those who didn't want to think about it much. 
- I want to help everyone, but need to admit that the real best person to help do this is themselves; by taking the initiative, being reflective, setting goals, and continously improving.

## Be Someone Who Gets Things Done
If you are not someone who get's things done, almost nothing else matters for your career. Pretty simple, work hard to finish the tasks you are assigned with enough quality at a decent pace. Over-deliver when you can. Also aim to get impactful things done. How to know what is impactful, understand your team and your customer's priorities, so ask questions accordingly.

## Ask For Feedback
Asking for feedback (genuinely) is one of the best ways to learn and grow. Try to avoid asking for general feedback, instead ask about specific things you worked on or led. Some examples include:
- Code review to improve your code
- Ideas and proposals to get thoughts and alignment
- Feature deliver (how did my owning this feature go?)
- Design documents; data design, solution diagram
Remember, feedback is a gift.

## Make Your Manager Your Ally
Your manager (in our case partially your tech lead) is the colleague who has the single biggest impact on your career within the company. A leader who believes in you, advocates for you, and supports you in your career goals makes a huge difference. So how can you move towards this?
1. Have a regular 1:1 time with your manager; discuss what you have been working on, talk about your goals and challenges
2. Understand your leader(s) goals; get a sense of what is important for the team, ask about what is the biggest upcoming challenges for the next month and half year
3. Establish trust; it's earned over time, aim to be honest and transparent with them.
4. Get your work recognized; present great work in larger team meetings, this is good for both your promotion case and your team.

## Pace Yourself
Athletes pace themselves for peak performance. In a similar fashion, the "stretching, executing, and coasting" model is useful.

- Executing
