# Software Develop*er* Lifecycle (SDLC)

- Throughout University the path is pretty clear. Go to class, or at least read the slides, do the homework and occasionally go to a tutorial session or your smart friends to beg for help (pre-chatgpt days). Also, do some leetcode questions and try to build some cool things the side. 
- When you enter your career as a software developer you suddenly realize you are in a totally different world. For some that are lucky this is in some internships/co-ops, for many others these days, it is after they have worked their butt off to find role that will take a chance on new dev. 
- For most roles, computer science folk enter the job market wondering where how they will write their first API in O(N) time complexity. Software engineering graduates stress about how to properly use git and what the hell CI/CD is? 
- But worse, most do not even know what actually matters when you become a software engineer. What are my career paths as a software engineers? Do I have to become a manager to grow in my career? What matters most at the different levels of software engineering? 

# Why Care About Your Career

- Before diving into learning how you might understand and excel as a software engineer, I realized I should take moment to explain why I think it matters. For me, it is not about being devoted to the corporate ladder or trying to get a great title to impress my friends; although it does get a laugh to say at a party that "I am a very wise and experienced 25 year old *Senior* Engineer". 
- Much of it to me comes from Cal Newport and his writing, specifically his book "So Good They Can't Ignore You". Here he introduces the idea that "Skills Trump Passion in the Quest for Work You Love". 
- Furthermore, he goes on that you shoud build what he calls “career capital”: the rare and valuable skills you accumulate so you can later spend them on a career that fits you. In team form, that idea becomes: become so good at something that you earn interesting problems to solve. Not even just as in someone gifts you these special tasks, but that when you seek to solve an interesting problem that calls for you, you are capable of executing that.
- Cal also adds that skill mastery isn’t just for career satisfaction; it’s how we invent the future, earn autonomy, and ultimately choose the direction of our own work, rather than being passengers to it. 

# Map of a Successful Software Developer Career
- As many of you know, these ideas are not concepts I was stumbled on originally, most of them are from some of the several amazing books I was lucky enough to find. They present these ideas much better than I can and I recommend you read them, but it just takes a bit longer.
We will follow a similar structure to the Software Engineering Guidebook by Gergely Orsov with my own filter and other ideas from The Effective Engineer by Edmond Lau, Talking with Tech Leads by Patrick Kua, Staff Engineer by Will Larson, and The Staff Engineer's Path by Tanya Reilly. 
1. Developer Career Foundations
2. The Competent Software Developer
3. The Well-Rounded Software Engineer
4. The Pragmatic Tech Lead
5. Role-Model Staff and Principal Engineers

# Developer Career Foundations
- There are many topics to discuss here, you can be specific about the axes of competent software engineers. In brainstorming for the presentation I grouped them into the buckets of:
1. Technical Foundations; language expertise, core CS, tooling, etc.
2. System Design and Code Quality; shaping systems and code well.
3. Operational Excellence; does it work in production?
4. Product and Domain Thinking; problem/domain understanding and focus on impact.
5. Problem Solving and Engineering Judgement
6. Communication and Collaboration; amplify others
7. Leadership, Ownership, and Growth; drive outcomes and grow your team.
You can come back and read these, but these could all be presentation in itself.

I am more concerned with the meta skills that developers should be aware of as foundations to grow.

Some of the essential ones that come to mind are:
- Optimize for learning/feedback
- Focus on high leverage activities
- Invest in iteration speed
- Own your career


## Reflections after writing for first couple hours
- Feels like I am developing two different talks. One is on the career path concepts, and another is on how to be a great engineer. I should likely separate these out into two talks
- Should probably cut the less interesting parts down a bit
