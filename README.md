# Software Developer Lifecycle

I created this repo to be a presentation for my engineering team at BMO to outline some of engineering career ideas I wish I knew when first getting into the industry.

Most (if not all) of the ideas in this presentation came from some reading of some book or block. I mention several of them throughout and also have some references at the end for individuals to dig into themselves.
